# This script should generate some of the static content each night
# after the market has closed and the most recent GSPC-closing-price
# is available from Yahoo.

# The static content should help me compare effectiveness of GSPC
# predictions computed from Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.

# If you have questions, e-me: bikle101@gmail.com

# I should create a folder to hold CSV data:
mkdir -p ~/reg4us/public/csv/
